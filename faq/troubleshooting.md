# Troubleshooting

- Q: The Plugin does not seem to work.
    - A: Make sure that you have followed the installation guide carefully, and that you have the correct dependencies installed. \
         If the plugin has initialized properly, you should see a line that says `[Touch Gestures:Info]   Initialized` in OpenTabletDriver's console. \
         At that point you should also be able to trigger the gestures you have set up & you the interface should be able to connect to the plugin.

- Q: The driver does not seem to go past 'Waiting for debugger to attach...' in the console.
    - A: Oops, i may have forgot to set the build configuration to Release instead of Debug, let me know on github if this is the case.
