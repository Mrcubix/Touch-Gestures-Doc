# Basic

- Q: Can i prevent my cursor from moving when i use certain gestures?
  - A: Not currently, it is possible to cancel inputs via plugins, but i'm not sure on how to obtain the best of both worlds.

- Q: Can i use this without a touch tablet?
    - A: Not currently, however, i do think that being able to trigger single-touch festures with just a pen would be a good idea
         (Soft Keys for example).

- Q: Can i specify which tablet to configure?
    - A: Not currently, but an in-interface dropdown will be a neccessity for proper support of OpenTabletDriver 0.6.x & later.
