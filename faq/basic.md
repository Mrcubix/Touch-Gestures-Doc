# Basic

- Q: Can i prevent my cursor from moving when i use certain gestures?
  - A: Not currently, it is possible to cancel inputs via plugins, but i'm not sure on how to obtain the best of both worlds.

- Q: Can i use this without a touch tablet?
    - A: Not currently, however, i do think that being able to trigger single-touch gestures with just a pen would be a good idea
         (Soft Keys comes to mind).

- Q: Can i specify which tablet to configure?
    - A: You can change the configured tablet the same way as OpenTabletDriver 0.6,x, using a dropdown located at the bottom left of the interface.
         It is however only available in the 0.6.x version as it's the only version that currently supports multiple tablets.
