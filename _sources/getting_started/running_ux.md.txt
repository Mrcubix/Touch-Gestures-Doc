# Running the UX

Make sure that you have completed the [](../installation_guide/installation.md) steps before running the UX. \
The plugin is required to be enabled beforehand for the UX to be able to communicate with it.

Open the Interface Application that you downloaded during [](../installation_guide/installation.md).
Once that's done and it has connected successfully to the daemon, you may proceed to the next section of the guide.
