# Deleting a Gestures

To delete a gesture, you can click the red `-` button on the right most side of a gesture.

Once you have clicked it, a confirmation dialog will appear. Choose `Yes` to delete the gesture, or `No` to cancel the deletion.

If you have removed a gesture by accident, and have not yet clicked on the `Save` button, you can restart the application to restore the deleted gesture.
