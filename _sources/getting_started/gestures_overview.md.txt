# Gestures Overview

Once the UX has started & it has connected successfully to the plugin, you will see the following screen:

```{figure} img/gesture_overview_screen.png

```

This page contains an overview of all the gesture you will have set up. \
Currently, there are no gestures set up, so the application will let you know as above.

The `+` button in the top right corner will allow you to add a new gesture. \
The Search bar at the top will allow you to search for a specific gesture once you have some set up. \
The `Save` button in the bottom right corner will allow you to save your current configuration.

Most elements of this application have a tooltip that will appear when you hover over them, \
so do not hesitate to hover over an element if you are unsure of what it does.

Since there are no gestures set up, let's proceed with adding a new gesture in the next section.
