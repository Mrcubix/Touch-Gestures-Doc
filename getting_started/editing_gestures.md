# Editing an existing Gesture

Now that you have set up a gesture, you may want to edit it. \
If you only want to change the binding, you can do so without clicking on the `Edit` button, \
using the same means as in OpenTabletDriver.

Otherwise, you might want to for instance change the options or the tweaks of the gesture.
In this case, you will need to click on the `Edit` button.

After clicking on the `Edit` button, you will be taken to the setup screen of the gesture. \
From there, you can proceed to change settings as if you were setting up a new gesture.
To cancel the editing process, click on the `Cancel` button.
