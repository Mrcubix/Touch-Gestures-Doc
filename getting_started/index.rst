Getting Started
===============

Now that you have installed the plugin, Downloaded the Interface & made sure that it connects properly to the plugin, 
you should be able to start adding new gestures & tweaking them. \

(If you didn't follow the installation guide, it doesn't work & you complain on github, i will find you.)
